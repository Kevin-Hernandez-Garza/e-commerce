## Description 📖

- The `e-commerce` database application was built using VSCODE, Insomnia Core, and mySQL allows the user to implement `CRUD` methods for a retail store's Products, Categories, and Tags. Since this application isn't deployed there is a walkthrough demo video [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/OsOUaAATifiK8umU4wT2) if you would like to view how this application works.

## Installation

- This backend application can be installed by `clone` the repo onto your local computer, then inside the `terminal` use these following commands:
- 1. `mysql -u root -p` then enter your SQL password
- 2. `source db/schema.sql;` then after the database is created make sure it's there by `SHOW DATABASES;`
- 3. `exit;` to exit out the mySQL shell

- Once that is created, open "Insomnia Core", which will allow you to CRUD the endpoints for the `Products`, `Categories`, and `Tags`.

## Usage

- The user is able to create new products, tags , and categories as well as update, create, and delete some/all items if desired.
